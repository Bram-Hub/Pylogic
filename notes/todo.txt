pylogic

python-like syntax

v0.1:
translates, compiles and prints





notes

- read text files as strings, put into lists and separate by spaces and remove empty stuff, read indents

- make list of all rules/things

- save proof files
	- make some encryptable stuff in addition to being able to read them like text files?


- has some derived rules already available similar to plugins (can add/load more proof files like this)
	- same file types
	- make sure it doesn't have to retest everytime, so place tested check within file
	- groupable?



everything: write test cases for each one
